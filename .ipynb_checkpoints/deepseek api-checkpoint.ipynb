      "Okay, so I need to analyze this CV and extract the required information into a JSON structure. Let me go through each section step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, looking at the header of the CV: the name is OSSAMA AMHIH. That should be straightforward for \"nom_complet\". The email is given as @ossamaamhih amhihossama@gmail.com, which seems to be a combination, but I think we can extract \"amhihossama@gmail.com\" as the email. Wait, actually, the CV shows \"@ossamaamhih amhihossama@gmail.com\", so it's two emails? That might be a formatting issue. Maybe the correct email is \"amhihossama@gmail.com\". I'll go with that for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the telephone number is +212 774 50 67 82. So \"telephone\" should be this string. The location is listed as Tangier, Casabarata, Morocco, so \"localisation\" would be that string.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to professional experiences. The CV has some entries under \"WORK EXPERIENCE\". Let's parse them:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. SKILLS section mentions Social media management, Copywriting/writing, Graphic design, Advertising, Content creation, Project management, Email marketing.\n",
      "2. Under education, there are two institutes: ISITT (International Higher Institute of Tourism of Tangier) and Specialized institute of applied technology Route Sebta, Solicode Tangier. The dates for ISITT are Spt 2023 - Mars 2024, which I think is September 2023 to March 2024. Then for the other one, it's 2023-2024, but another entry says Sep 2022 - April 2023 and 2019-2021. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe they are listing different experiences? I'll need to structure them properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the first education is ISITT from Spt 2023 - Mars 2024 (September 2023 to March 2024), which is a specialized technician diploma in Web Development. The next one might be a certificate in Web Development from Solicode Tangier in 2022-2023. Then there's a mention of Professional Bachelor’s and a Specialized technician diploma, but the dates are overlapping and I'm not entirely sure how to structure them. It seems like the user may have made some mistakes in formatting. I'll list all education entries as separate objects with their respective diplomas, institutions, and years.\n",
      "\n",
      "For languages, the CV lists Arabic as native, English fluent, French fluent. The soft skills include Trello, Monday.com, Time management, Photoshop, Illustrator, Communication, WordPress, Shopify, Problem-Solving, French Fluent, Omnisend, Brevo, Teamwork, Canva, Empathy, and Emotional Intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the CV seems to have a mix of hard and soft skills. I need to parse them correctly into \"competences_cles\". The key competencies listed are Social media management, Copywriting/writing, Graphic design, Advertising, Content creation, Project management, Email marketing. So those should be in \"competences_cles\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The work experiences: the CV shows multiple entries under WORK EXPERIENCE and another section labeled SKILLSE D U C A T I O N, which seems to be a list of skills. Maybe that's separate from work experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking again, after the header, there are sections for WORK EXPERIENCE and SKILLSE... It might be that the WORK EXPERIENCE is actually a list of positions. Let me parse each line:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Imfluence.ae l Dubai UAE: Not sure what this is, perhaps a typo? Maybe it's Imfluence.ae, which could be a company name.\n",
      "- Tangier Travel Agency\n",
      "- Rhillane - 360 Digital Marketing Agency\n",
      "- Hotel and tourism marketing\n",
      "- Commerce\n",
      "- Arabic Copywriter\n",
      "- Digital Marketing Manager\n",
      "\n",
      "So these seem to be work experiences. I need to structure each as an object with poste, entreprise, durée, description.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the dates are a bit confusing:\n",
      "\n",
      "- For ISITT: Spt 2023 - Mars 2024 (September 2023 to March 2024)\n",
      "- For Solicode: 2022-2023\n",
      "- Then there's 2023-2024, which might refer to another period.\n",
      "- The Professional Bachelor’s and Certificate in Web Development don't have specific dates but are mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I should list each education as a separate object with the diploma, institution, and year. Even if some years overlap or aren't clear, I'll do my best to extract what I can.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, languages: Arabic (native), English (fluent), French (fluent). So \"langues\" would be a list of objects with nom_langue and niveau.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the JSON structure should have:\n",
      "\n",
      "- nom_complet: \"OSSAMA AMHIH\"\n",
      "- email: \"amhihossama@gmail.com\"\n",
      "- telephone: \"+212 774 50 67 82\"\n",
      "- localisation: \"Tangier, Casabarata, Morocco\"\n",
      "- competences_cles: the key skills listed\n",
      "- experiences_professionnelles: each work experience as an object\n",
      "- formations: each education as an object\n",
      "- langues: each language with level\n",
